# 3D-Design-Micro-Projects
A collection of Oscar's past design, modelling and 3D printing projects.

This is a collection of 3D designs for drones, RC airplanes, as well as other hobbies. I have beem  making these since 2015, some of these have been purchased over 100 times on Shapeways and they continue to be available for purchase as physycal printed items: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/tinyinvention

I have in the past made many of these files available on RC and DIY forums. But I've decided to put them in one place on Github for accessibility. Feel free to download, print, modify, and re-distribute.

All of the models are designed in SolidWorks.
