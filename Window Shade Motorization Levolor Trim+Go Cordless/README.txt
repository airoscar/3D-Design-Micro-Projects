Instructions:

Designed for Levolor Trim+Go Cordless Shade such as one seen here: https://www.lowes.com/pd/LEVOLOR-Trim-Go-Natural-Bamboo-Light-Filtering-Cordless-Indoor-Natural-Shade-Actual-60-in-x-64-in/1000576919

The shade uses a 6-mm shaft with 2 spline cut 180-degrees apart.
The involute_spur_gear has a center hole that incorporates the spline keyway which engages the shade's main shaft.
The involute_spur_gear is driven by the trans_gear for torque multiplication.
The trans_gear is in turn driven by the involute_pinion_gear for furthur torque multiplication.
The involute_pinion_gear is mounted directly on a motor that uses 6-mm shaft.

626ZZ bearings (6mmX19mmX6mm) are used throughout to support the gears and shafts.
Two bearings are used to support the shade's main shaft through the gearbox on each side of the involute_spur_gear.
Two bearings are used with the 6mm_trans_gear_shaft to support the trans_gear on both sides.
One bearing is mounted at the end of the motor shaft to support the involute_pinion_gear.

The spacer_6X1 is provided and can be used at the end of the 6_mm_trans_gear_shaft with a cotter pin (not included) to help locking the shaft in place.

The 18mm_motor_bushing is provided to help provide centering of the motor within the gearbox.

The motor_mount_adapter is provided to be used with the metal bracket that comes with the motor, and it provides torsional support.

The motor used is a 3/4" (21mm) tubular motor such as one linked here: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07CGHC2GB/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_i_Hz13DbFG2ZD0D
